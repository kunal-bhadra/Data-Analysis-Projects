    "In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to a very popular technology site, Hacker News. This is a website where posts made by users are voted and get commented upon, very similar in functionality to Reddit. Posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. \n",

Ask HN posts are concerned with asking the community a specific question while Show HN posts are concerned with showing the community a project or a product.
