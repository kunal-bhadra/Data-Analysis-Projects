# Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

I worked on this project, while learning **Pandas** and **NumPy** and applied the concepts here. I cleaned and analyzed a real-life dataset to answer questions that stakeholders may have about their employee retention. After our analysis, we were able to predict why a particular set of employees may be leaving.


## Data Processing Steps Done:
1. Identify Missing Values and Drop Unnecessary Columns
2. Clean Column Names
3. Filter and Verify the data
4. Create a New Column
5. Identify Dissatisfied Employees
6. Combine the Data
7. Clean the Service Column
8. Perform Initial Analysis
