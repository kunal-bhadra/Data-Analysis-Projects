    "# Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from eployees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Acting as a data analyst in this project, we answer some of the questions that stakeholders may have: \n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?"
