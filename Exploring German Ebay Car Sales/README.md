# Exploring German Ebay Car Sales

This is the second project I worked on while learning **Pandas** and **NumPy** and applied their concepts here. After cleaning a dataset on my own, I employed new Pandas methods and uncovered insights which isn't possible by just looking at the CSV table. In the end, I presented my analysis to support my code.


## Exploratory Data Analysis Steps Done:
1. Cleaning Column Names
2. Initial Exploration and Cleaning
3. Exploring the Odometer and Price Columns
4. Exploring the date columns
5. Dealing with Incorrect Registration Year Data
6. Exploring Price by Brand
7. Storing Aggregate Data in a DataFrame
8. Present Initial Analysis
