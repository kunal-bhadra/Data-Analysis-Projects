# Data Analysis Projects

A compilation of all the Data Analysis projects I have worked on, to apply my concepts of **Pandas** and **NumPy**.

## Brief Outline
### 📃 Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys
Cleaned and analyzed a real-life dataset to answer questions that stakeholders may have about their employee retention. 


### 🚗 Exploring German Ebay Car Sales
Cleaned a dataset on my own and employed new Pandas methods to present my analysis in support of my code. 


### 🐱‍💻 Optimal Time for Hacker News Posts
 Utilized loops to explore CSV data, analysed it with Clean string methods and processed the dates in Python.

 - Identifying Missing Values and Dropping Unnecessary Columns
 - Cleaning Column Names
 - Filtering, Verifying and storing the Aggregate Data
 - Univariate Analysis to explore each column
