# Optimal Time for Hacker News Posts

This is the third project I worked on while learning **Pandas** and **NumPy** and applied their concepts here. After employing loops to explore the CSV data, we analysed the data with Clean string methods and processed the dates in Python.


## Exploratory Data Analysis Steps Done:
1. Removing Headers from a List of Lists
2. Extracting Ask HN and Show HN Posts
3. Calculating the Average Number of Comments for Ask HN and Show HN Posts
4. Finding the Number of Ask Posts and Comments by Hour Created
5. Calculating the Average Number of Comments for Ask HN Posts by Hour
6. Sorting and Printing Values from a List of Lists
7. Present Initial Analysis
